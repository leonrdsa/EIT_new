# Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) Signal Reconstruction

This is the official implementation for the paper:  
**_Data-Driven Phantom Imaging in EIT with Physically Controlled Ground Truth_**

This repository contains code and documentation related to signal reconstruction using Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) data. The project involves processing voltage measurements from 16 electrode pins and reconstructing internal structures based on these readings.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle:

👉 [EIT Signal Reconstruction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eehernandez/eit-signal-reconstruction)

The dataset includes:
- Voltage measurements from 16 electrodes
- 2048 samples per electrode per cycle
- Multiple configurations with 1 to 4 circular phantoms
- Labeled and vectorized image data for supervised learning
